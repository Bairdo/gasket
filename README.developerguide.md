## FAUCET developer guide

This file contains an overview of architecture, coding design/practices, testing and style.

### Before submitting a PR

* All unit tests must pass (please use the docker based tests; see README.docker.md).
* You must add a test if FAUCET's functionality changes (ie. a new feature, or correcting a bug).
* pylint must show no new errors or warnings.
* Code must conform to the style guide (see below).

### Code style

Please use the coding style documented at http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html. Existing
code not using this style will be incrementally migrated to comply with it. New code should comply.

### Key architectural concepts/assumptions.

FAUCET's architecture depends on key assumptions, which must be kept in mind at all times.

* FAUCET is the only controller for the switch, that can add or remove flows.
* All supported dataplanes must implement OpenFlow functionally (hardware, software or both) identically. No TTP or switch specific drivers.

In addition:

* FAUCET provisions default deny flows (all traffic not explicitly programmed is dropped).
* Use of packet in is minimized.

FAUCET depends upon these assumptions to gaurantee that the switch is always in a known and consistent
state, which in turn is required to support high availability (FAUCET provides high availability, through
multiple FAUCET controllers using the same version of configuration - any FAUCET can give the switch
a consistent response - no state sharing between controllers is required). The FAUCET user can program
customized flows to be added to the switch using FAUCET ACLs (see below).

FAUCET also programs the dataplane to do flooding (where configured). This minimizes the use of packet in.
This is necessary to reduce competition between essential control plane messages (adding and removing flows),
and traffic from the dataplane on the limited bandwidth OpenFlow control channel. Unconstrained packet in messages
impact the switch CPU, may overwhelm the OpenFlow control channel, and will expose the FAUCET controller to
unvalidated dataplane packets, all of which are security and reliability concerns. In future versions
packet in will be eliminated altogether. The FAUCET user is expected to use policy based forwarding
(eg ACLs that redirect traffic of interest to high performance dataplane ports for NFV offload), not packet in.

FAUCET requires all supported dataplanes to implement OpenFlow (specifically, a subset of OpenFlow 1.3)
in a functionally identical way. This means that there is no switch-specific driver layer - the exact same
messages are sent, whether the switch is OVS or hardware. While this does prevent some earlier generation
OpenFlow switches from being supported, commercially available current hardware does not have as many restrictions,
and eliminating the need for a switch-specific (or TTP) layer greatly reduces implementation complexity and
increases controller programmer productivity.

INSTALLING FAUCET CONTROLLER

(Assuming FAUCET has been already installed via pip, or git cloned locally):

    sudo useradd -m faucet
    sudo mkdir /var/log/faucet
    sudo chown faucet:faucet -R /var/log/faucet
    sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/faucet/
    sudo cp faucet.yaml-dist /etc/opt/faucet/faucet.yaml
    sudo cp upstart/faucet /etc/default/
    sudo cp upstart/faucet.conf /etc/init/

Then edit /etc/opt/faucet/faucet.yaml to configure ports, VLANs, DPID, etc,
and /etc/default/faucet to point to where FAUCET has been installed.

To start FAUCET:

    sudo service faucet start


INSTALLING GAUGE (MONITORING)

    sudo cp gauge.conf-dist /etc/opt/faucet/gauge.conf
    sudo cp upstart/gauge /etc/default/
    sudo cp upstart/gauge.conf /etc/init/

Then edit /etc/opt/faucet/gauge.conf to point to FAUCET's YAML config,
and /etc/default/gauge to point to where FAUCET/gauge have been installed.
